# AutoBlend is now available on the Unreal Engine Fab marketplace! ðŸš€

Complex blending between objects in Unreal Engine is now easier than ever with AutoBlend.
This plugin allows you to blend objects seamlessly using a post-process effect, without the need for complex material setups or manual adjustments.

I'll be taking all feedback, criticism, compliments, hate mail, snail mail, morse code and smoke signals from the community!
If you have any problems or suggestions, please let me know and I'll incorporate it into the next version.

You can get plugin on the [Unreal Engine Fab marketplace](https://www.fab.com/listings/b474f704-c319-4fd0-87f3-651931da6b33).
