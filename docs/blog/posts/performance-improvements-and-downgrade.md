# Performance improvements and downgrade

I'm working on a patch that will improve performance by a lot after some users have reported slowness.

Additionally, some people have requested a backport to Unreal Engine `5.1`-`5.5` as well as some `4.x` versions.
For now I'll be focusing on `5.x` only, if I get extra time and it's not too complicated I'll add `4.x` support as well.

You can check out the full roadmap [here](/autoblend/features).

Should be ready soon!
