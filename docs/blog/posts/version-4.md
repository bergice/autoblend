# Version 4 is out, exposure fix and debug view blending!

Previously the shader would brighten the image slightly due to not taking exposure into account.
This is now fixed.

Additionally you can now fade in the debug view, making it easier to see what is being blended.

You can get plugin on the [Unreal Engine Fab marketplace](https://www.fab.com/listings/b474f704-c319-4fd0-87f3-651931da6b33).
