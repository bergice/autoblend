# Version 2 is out, bringing performance improvements!

Performance improvements are out.
The shader should now be a lot faster thanks to an optimized edge detection algorithm.

Read the [Performance](/autoblend/performance) page for more details.

I'll be downgrading the minimum supported Unreal Engine version to `5.1` next.

You can get plugin on the [Unreal Engine Fab marketplace](https://www.fab.com/listings/b474f704-c319-4fd0-87f3-651931da6b33).
