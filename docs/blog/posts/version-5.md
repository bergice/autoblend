# Version 5 is out, backwards compatibility fix!

Version 4 accidentally broke backwards compatibility with Unreal Engine 5.1-5.5.
If you had issues with the shader material not showing up, please update to this version.

You can get plugin on the [Unreal Engine Fab marketplace](https://www.fab.com/listings/b474f704-c319-4fd0-87f3-651931da6b33).
